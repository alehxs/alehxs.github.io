# Welcome to My Blog

Hey! You have found my blog! I decided I this year, I wanted to document my journey and write about the things I'm learning.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Project Retrospectives** - Deep dives into things I've built
- **Learning in Public** - Sharing my journey, mistakes, and breakthroughs
- **Random Thoughts** - Whatever catches my interest

## Why I'm Doing This

Writing helps me:

1. **Solidify my understanding** - Teaching forces you to truly understand
2. **Track my growth** - Looking back at old posts shows progress
3. **Practice communication** - Writing is a critical skill for engineers

## What's Next

I've already published a few posts to get started:

- How I built this portfolio with React and vintage design
- Thoughts on vintage web design aesthetics

There's more to come. Thank you for reading!

**—Alex**
