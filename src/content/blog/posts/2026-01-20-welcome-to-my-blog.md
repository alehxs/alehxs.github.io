# Welcome to My Blog

Hey there! Welcome to my blog—a space where I'll be documenting my journey as a software engineer, sharing what I'm learning, and exploring topics that fascinate me.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Web Development** - React patterns, CSS techniques, performance optimization
- **Design** - Creating unique and memorable user experiences
- **Learning in Public** - Sharing my journey, mistakes, and breakthroughs
- **Project Retrospectives** - Deep dives into things I've built
- **Random Thoughts** - Whatever catches my interest

## Why I'm Doing This

Writing helps me:

1. **Solidify my understanding** - Teaching forces you to truly understand
2. **Track my growth** - Looking back at old posts shows progress
3. **Give back** - If my experiences help even one person, it's worth it
4. **Practice communication** - Writing is a critical skill for engineers

## What's Next

I've already published a few posts to get started:

- How I built this portfolio with React and vintage design
- My journey learning React Hooks
- Thoughts on vintage web design aesthetics

More to come soon! Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful or interesting here.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat about any of these topics.

**—Alex**
